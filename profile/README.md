# Skyward-Brawlhalla
In this organisation you can find all my brawlhalla related projects. Here's a short explanation per repository.

## [Dadabase](https://github.com/Skyward-Brawlhalla/Dadabase)
Discord bot that collects data mainly for the discord bot [Ranknir](https://github.com/Skyward-Brawlhalla/Ranknir). While Ranknir is stuck in an endless loop, Dadabase makes it possible to make changes to this endless loop without stopping it.
## [Queen-Spy](https://github.com/Skyward-Brawlhalla/Queen-Spy)
Discord bot that let's you link Discord accounts to Brawlhalla accounts unlocking interesting features.
## [MoneySquadronVirus](https://github.com/Skyward-Brawlhalla/MoneySquadronVirus)
Discord bot that sends memes
## Why is this organisation called Skyward-Brawlhalla?
The first bots I made were specifically aimed at the clan Skyward. Later on I started expanding the bots to other servers. The name skyward-brawlhalla isn't too relevant anymore but it has some nostalgia attached to it. Maybe if I find a better name for this I'll rename it.
